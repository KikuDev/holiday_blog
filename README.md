# HolidayBlog

This project has been initiated for family photo share. It aims to provide a single environnement for entire group (in my case, family).

Front :
- Angular 6
- Sass

Back : 
- Nodejs
- Mongodb

## Development server

For Front End : 
- npm install
- ng serve

For Back End : 
- cd server
- npm install
- node (or nodemon) server.js

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
